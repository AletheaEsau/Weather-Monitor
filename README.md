# Weather-Monitor
This application helps to measure and gather atmospheric conditions like air temperature, humidity, moisturizer, light intensity, rainfall, ultraviolet (UV) radiations, barometric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, cloud height, and other abnormal conditions. This helps you check the weather at any time and don't have to wait for news to know what will the weather be for tomorrow and it is not just for the next day, it gives the forecast for the entire week. Weather is something everybody deals with, and accurate data of it like what is coming can help users to make inform decisions. With weather apps for iOS and Android, people can exactly know when to expect a change in the weather conditions. Weather apps can give urgent alerts too. This weather app I have created is is friendly to the eye and looks very pleasing, it is colourful, maybe some weather apps look boring and not fun and yes a weather app is not supposed to look fun but I thought it would be good a good idea to feed my audience with a fun looking app.
